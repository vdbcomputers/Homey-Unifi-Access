# Unifi access

he ability to receive data from the UniFi Access API expands the integration with the UniFi Access ecosystem. Currently, it is only possible to receive device notifications, but these notifications are stored as usable data that can be further processed or triggered in flows within the system. This means that as soon as a notification or alert from a UniFi device is received, this information is automatically stored and made available for further actions, analysis, or reporting.

Key Features

Receiving Device Notifications:

The API receives notifications from UniFi Access devices. This could be a notification of a door being opened, a card reader being activated, or an error message from a connected UniFi device. Notifications are received in real-time, ensuring the system is always up-to-date with the latest alerts from the devices.

Data Storage and Availability in Flows:

All received notifications are stored as data entities. This data is directly accessible for use in automated processes. Users can set specific actions or alerts in response to these notifications, such as sending an alert to a security team upon a door-open event or logging all events for future reference.
